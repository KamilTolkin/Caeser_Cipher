        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar
          ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are
          shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet.
          A Caesar cipher with a key of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an
          N, and a Z as an A, and so on. This webpage can convert your message
          using any key (1-25, anything lower or higher is already covered by
          this range).

          The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to
          Suetonius, used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when
          encrypting, and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of
          military significance. While Caesar's was the first recorded use of
          this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used
          earlier.<br />It is unknown how effective the Caesar cipher was at the
          time; there is no record at that time of any techniques for the
          solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving
          records date to the 9th-century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world
          with the discovery of frequency analysis.

          A Caesar cipher with a shift of one is used on the back of the mezuzah
          to encrypt the names of God. This may be a holdover from an earlier
          time when Jewish people were not allowed to have mezuzot. The letters
          of the cryptogram themselves comprise a religiously significant
          "divine name" which Orthodox belief holds keeps the forces of evil in
          check.

          In the 19th century, the personal advertisements section in newspapers
          would sometimes be used to exchange messages encrypted using simple
          cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in
          secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times.
          Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army
          employed it as a replacement for more complicated ciphers which had
          proved to be too difficult for their troops to master; German and
          Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their
          messages.

          A construction of two rotating disks with a Caesar cipher can be used
          to encrypt or decrypt the code. Caesar ciphers can be found today in
          children's toys such as secret decoder rings. A Caesar shift of
          thirteen is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of
          obfuscating text widely found on Usenet and used to obscure text (such
          as joke punchlines and story spoilers), but not seriously used as a
          method of encryption.

          The Vigen√®re cipher uses a Caesar cipher with a different shift at
          each position in the text; the value of the shift is defined using a
          repeating keyword. If the keyword is as long as the message, is chosen
          at random, never becomes known to anyone else, and is never reused,
          this is the one-time pad cipher, proven unbreakable. The conditions
          are so difficult they are, in practical effect, never achieved.
          Keywords shorter than the message (e.g., "Complete Victory" used by
          the Confederacy during the American Civil War), introduce a cyclic
          pattern that might be detected with a statistically advanced version
          of frequency analysis.<br />
          In April 2006, fugitive Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano was captured in
          Sicily partly because some of his messages, clumsily written in a
          variation of the Caesar cipher, were broken. Provenzano's cipher used
          numbers, so that "A" would be written as "4", "B" as "5", and so on.

          In 2011, Rajib Karim was convicted in the United Kingdom of "terrorism
          offences" after using the Caesar cipher to communicate with
          Bangladeshi Islamic activists discussing plots to blow up British
          Airways planes or disrupt their IT networks. Although the parties had
          access to far better encryption techniques (Karim himself used PGP for
          data storage on computer disks), they chose to use their own scheme
          (implemented in Microsoft Excel), rejecting a more sophisticated code
          program called Mujahedeen Secrets "because 'kaffirs', or
          non-believers, know about it, so it must be less secure".
